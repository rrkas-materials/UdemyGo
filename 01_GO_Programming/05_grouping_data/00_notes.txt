Array--------------------------------------------
    An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type, called the element type. 
    The number of elements is called the length of the array and is never negative.
Slice--------------------------------------------
    A slice is a descriptor for a contiguous segment of an underlying array and 
    provides access to a numbered sequence of elements from that array. 
    A slice type denotes the set of all slices of arrays of its element type. 
    The number of elements is called the length of the slice and is never negative. 
    The value of an uninitialized slice is nil.
Map----------------------------------------------
    A map is an unordered group of elements of one type, called the element type, 
    indexed by a set of unique keys of another type, called the key type. 
    The value of an uninitialized map is nil.
Struct-------------------------------------------
    A struct is a sequence of named elements, called fields, each of which has a name and a type. 
    Field names may be specified explicitly (IdentifierList) or implicitly (EmbeddedField). 
    Within a struct, non-blank field names must be unique.
